# webpack-react-tutorial
Basic tutorial front to back to setup ReactJS with webpack

# Why???

> "Another tutorial?  There's so many out there already." - The Internet

Yes...there are.  My friend was talking to me one day about how every tutorial he's seen with React and Webpack assume you know some things already.  So I'm gonna go through it step by step, as if you were a complete idiot without being condescending.

# The What

1. Creating a new project
2. Initializing the project with NPM
3. Setting up your package.json file
4. Installing the packages we want (React, Webpack)
5. Setting up webpack for your project
6. Setting up the webpack.config.js file
7. Writing some components with React in ES6!
